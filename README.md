# SIR Model Simulation
## Overview
This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. It features a deterministic or stochastic backend for efficient computation and a Streamlit frontend for interactive visualization of disease spread and control strategies.

## Features
- SIR Model Simulation: Models the dynamics of disease spread among a population, with compartments for Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered individuals.
- Stochastic or Deterministic Backend: Utilizes either stochastic or deterministic programming to simulate the spread of the disease.

- Streamlit Frontend: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for visualizing the simulation results, including plots of disease prevalence over time and the impact of different control strategies.
